## The Challenge

The client's sales team was overwhelmed by a high volume of low-quality leads from WhatsApp, consuming valuable time. The lack of 24/7 availability led to lost opportunities, and the manual, inconsistent qualification process was not scalable for growth.

## My Solution

I architected and deployed an end-to-end AI solution on WhatsApp to function as a fully autonomous sales agent.

*   **Conversational Flow & NLU:** Leveraged **Google Dialogflow** for robust natural language understanding and conversational flow management.
*   **Intelligence Layer:** Integrated the system with **Google's Gemini API** to create a sophisticated LLM-powered agent, trained on the company's sales playbook and product data. This allowed the bot to handle complex queries, score leads in real-time, and engage users naturally.
*   **Automation & CRM Integration:** Used **N8N** as the automation backbone to seamlessly push highly-qualified leads and their full conversation history directly into the **RD Station CRM**, alerting the sales team for immediate, high-context follow-up.

## The Results (Impact on the Business)

> ✅ **+50% Increase in Sales Conversion Rate** from qualified leads.
> 
> 📈 **+30% Growth in Monthly Sales-Qualified Leads (SQLs).**
> 
> ⚙️ **Reduced Manual Lead Qualification Tasks by over 80%**, freeing up the sales team to focus exclusively on closing deals.
